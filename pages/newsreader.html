# Newsreader service

FreshRSS is a free, open source, reliable and ergonomic service with web interface (which is usable on mobile) and API for mobile apps.

I've set up [news.decent.im](https://news.decent.im) to use it myself and share it with others.

As with the [XMPP service](/usage/), I use it daily and I like it very much.

**[Take a look at my own selection of news sources to get a taste](https://news.decent.im/i/?a=normal&state=3).**
