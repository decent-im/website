# Newsreader service

FreshRSS is a free, open source, reliable and ergonomic service with web interface (which is usable on mobile) and API for mobile apps.

I've set up [news.decent.im](https://news.decent.im) to use it myself and share it with others.

As with the [XMPP service](/register/), I use it daily and I like it very much.

**[Take a look at my own selection of news sources to get a taste](https://news.decent.im/i/?a=normal&state=3).**

# **[Buy an account](https://news.decent.im/i/?c=customer&a=pay)**

**[Manage subscription](https://billing.stripe.com/p/login/4gw8zd35Ga7dbFC7ss)**

So nice and affordable that you want to tip? [Donate to Ukraine instead](/donate-to-ukraine/).

If we know each other, or your work in public interest is known to me, please [contact me](mailto:customer-support@autkin.net) to request an account for free.
