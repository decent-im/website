Prosody developer MattJ gave a talk this week on the topic of 
[Spam, Abuse and Moderation](https://mov.im/node/pubsub.movim.eu/berlin-xmpp-meetup/mattj-talks-about-spam-abuse-and-moderation-7fJ5za)
discussing many aspects of keeping the users, servers and entire XMPP network safe.

Prompted by the talk, I [enabled the spam reporting modules](https://github.com/decent-im/decent.im/commit/8db83f8c9c609f4d5fb4a3312962efb634702d4b).
