During this time, not much happened:

* staging server dev.decent.im shut down

  It wasn't actively used by me for few months, but it costs the same as production host. I decided to stop this waste
  of funds.

  Of course now I need to be more cautious when applying changes to produciton, or at last I should not start testing
  stuff on production server. I am thinking of making it more possible to replicate entire setup in a locla environment
  not having all properties of real public server (e.g. public static IP). But this is yet to be resolved in future.

* intermittently, unattended upgrade was broken because lua-expat upstream website was down:

  lua-expat author has kindly brought up the site on my request. It was brought down manually to stop DoS attack which
  was mounted against his website.
