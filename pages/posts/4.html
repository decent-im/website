Happy new 2018 year!

During last month, this happened:

* spectrum build failure was resolved

  To fix that, I submitted upstream a [pull request](https://github.com/SpectrumIM/spectrum2/pull/252)
  with a trivial patch, which was accepted (not without a bit of bikeshedding with upstream maintainer).

* biboumi, the awesome IRC gateway, was integrated to production service

  biboumi is a great software, featuring a bunch of nice capabilities, for example, message archive access for IRC rooms
  user is attending. This means no more missed bits in IRC conversations!

  biboumi previously could use only SQLite database, which was considered by me a major downside. Finally, with a help
  of our very humble donation, the upstream maintainer recently added PostgreSQL support! Then, I have added it to
  production server (as well as staging server dev.decent.im). Existing `irc.decent.im` component, previously served
  by Spectrum & libcommini based gateway, was replaced with biboumi, for convenience and clarity. (Previously I
  considered putting it to horrific URI ``biboumi.irc.decent.im``).

* one more user joined decent.im :)

  Our server is not boasting a huge user base, but I value every person who puts trust into decent.im!
