**Here comes a decent XMPP server!**

Fed up with the carouselle of Proprietary Messaging Networks of the Day?
Try an open, federated network running and evolving since 1999, based on free and open source software and the protocol standartized by IETF!
Today, XMPP practically supports such long-desired features as video calls and convenient end to end encryption.

This page used to say: "stay in touch with your contacts using provided gateways to other IM networks!".
Nowadays, it's a violation of Terms of Service of proprietary networks to use non-official software.
So bridging is practically possible only to other open networks where owners respect your freedom.
Currently decent.im runs a gateway only for IRC.

<a href="https://github.com/decent-im/">Server configs and code are public.</a>
